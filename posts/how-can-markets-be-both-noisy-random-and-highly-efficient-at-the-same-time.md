> Q: "How can markets be both noisy/random and highly efficient at the same time

\> if someone is prepared to trade at bad prices, there's a competitive race to take the other side. 

\>﻿ that effectively pushes prices back towards where they should be

\> the PnL of traders taking the other side can be thought of as payment for pushing the market back towards "good prices" 

\> identifiable pricing inefficiencies will be exploited for profit in this way 

\> what tends to remain is the stuff that is unforecastable and unexploitable

\>﻿ so what remains looks like noise

\>﻿ and rational things that \*should\* persist, such as discounts for risky stuff (risk premia.)

a practical definition of market efficiency is "it's hard to make money trading cos those folks with the microwave towers have eaten all the obvious arbs"
