f﻿riend asks "how do i know how scalable this strategy is?"

o﻿ne very simple thing you can do to get an idea, is to look at the decay in simulated performance when you delay acting upon your signals.

h﻿ow much worse does it look if you delay your rebalance trades by 15m, 60m, 4h etc?

s﻿low decay means you might have a chance of sizing it up.

i﻿f it falls off a cliff, you probably gotta stay small and nimble in that strategy.

we're always trading at other people's prices and can only eat what we are fed.

b﻿eep....boop
