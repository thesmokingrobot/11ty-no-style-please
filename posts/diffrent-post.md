c﻿ommon argument...

"﻿you, an individual, could never compete with that"

o﻿f course.

y﻿ou shouldn't even try.

s﻿o why can many of us small speculators do ok?

*b﻿y playing totally different games*

generally, you got two things in your favour:


1. ability to pick spots
2. ability to go after small opportunities.

The basic idea is:
1. do useful things
2. in uncompetitive places

What is useful?
- Taking on risk others dont want
- Trading with price-insensitive people (people who are forced or have weird objectives)
- Pushing dislocations back towards equilibrium


but lots of people are trying to do that.


doing useful things is a competitive business.


so, you need to find places to do it that kinda suck.

- maybe the opportunities don't come along that often
- maybe the size of the mispricings is small 
- maybe it involves risks or operational effort that doesn't scale well or is unacceptable to bigger firms.

do useful things that kinda suck, basically.


yeah, I know, real glamorous right?
