for small independent traders who are "full-time", applying "pro" trading approaches at tiny scale or in highly constrained places can work.

* play where your tiny size is actually size
* or do the arb but just trade the good leg 
* or be in and out like a ninja on the 1 lot 

but you have to be careful that you take the "idea", not the "implementation".



talk to some guy that does high frequency trading at scale and nearly everything he will tell you is important for him, isn't important for you.


you gotta steal the "essence" of things 

and then hack up the crappiest acceptable first implementation to get in the market.


for me this is often spreadsheets and clicking, if possible.


if not, it's a knowingly sh!tty bot that needs babysitting, based on the simplest signal possible (so i can understand it.)

i﻿f you get prissy about it, you'll miss it all.
