if you put a trade on, the following can happen.

there are two sources of variance in your outcomes:
1. am I right or wrong?
2. am I lucky? (did random unforecastable events help or hinder my position)

for small numbers of trades, 2 totally dominates.

this is why concentrating big in single ideas is a bad idea, even if you have a ton of conviction.

even if you *know* you're right, unforecastable random events can easily derail you trade (policy change, whatever)

...and you don't know you're right.

raoul pal recently bought the top in ETH, in a trade that he described as "irresponsibly large".

if that was real, he would have lost a lot of money. 

but it would have been a shit trade even if it had made money - because there was so much chance of losing money even if he was "right".

you've got no right betting the farm on coin flip ideas like that.

> "how can i not wreck myself if i'm wrong?"

NOT "how can i make the most money, given i know i'm right?"

you never know you're right. and, even when you are, there's still a good chance you'll get unlucky.

beep....boop.
