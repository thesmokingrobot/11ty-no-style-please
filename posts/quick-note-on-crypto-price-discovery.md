p﻿rompt from friend:

i﻿ think it can be both, sometimes in different places.

c﻿rypto "price discovery" at the exchange you're trading can be a bit like that for a single derivative contract...

...i﻿n that information-based price discovery is mostly happening somewhere else (more liquid venue, moves in global risk generally.)

a﻿nd the price of the thing you are trading stays close to it because of arbs and quoter fair price models.

b﻿ut deviates from it because of lack of liquidity or lumpiness of price-taking supply and demand (liquidations, fat fingers, donkey whales etc.)

m﻿ight be a useful model for you. like all models it's kinda wrong and kinda right. 

maybe it's useful? 

after all, all we need to do is throw shit in vaguely the right direction and hope some of it sticks...

b﻿eep....boop.
